tpBranches is a is a 3 column theme with a horizontal menu across the header and a vertical menu on the left. The
horizontal menu shows the top most menu items while the vertical menu shows the second and greater level menus. 
The sub menu by default also shows the top level menu as the first item; this can be suppressed by giving the top
level menu the class of 'hidden'. The theme supports 2 widgetized sidebars on the right, and three widgetized
areas in the footer. The center column is flexible and automatically adjusts for the current browser window width.

The theme supports several styles and a customized logo in the Theme Options section.

The theme cupport an options slideshow on the home page. The slideshow is made from five individual graphic files
which can be set in the Theme Options section of the back end. In addition, the link for each slide can be set here
too.

The slideshow is aware of the browser window size and will respond to automatically fit in a smaller window size.

For minor styling changes please edit custom.css rather than styles.css. Any styling in custom.css will take
precedent over styles.css and ease the process of theme updating.

Since this is a variable width theme, please pay attention to the width of images. I suggest that you modify
the settings/media section of the administrative area to disply medium images at no more than 500x500 and large
images at no more than 900x900. Keep in mind that large images may not display as inended on screens less than 1024
pixels wide.

I've authored several themes for individual sites; tpBranches is my second theme intended for wide distribution; I
would appreciate comments. I have some other themes in process to meet specialized layout requirements. I wanted
to give something back to the many people who helped me learn CSS, WordPress, php and jQuery through their blogs.
Thanks!

It is completely optional, but if you like the theme I would appreciate it if you keep the credit link in the footer.
